# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe (also called 'noughts and crosses' or 'Xs and Os' depending on locale) game that can be played in the terminal that's written in Rust. I created this project as a way to learn Rust. I read through the first few chapters of the Rust book and then wrote the project. Whilst the game works fine, I may rewrite the project in the future once I've read through more of the book. I'm not planning to add many (if any) new features to this project at the moment, but if there's any interest in doing so, feel free to open an issue for discussion, I'm open to accept contributions.

This project is not currently on crates.io as it's just a binary crate, but I may restructure it as a library in the future and publish it to crates.io.

This repo is freely published under the MIT license. I noticed a lot of other Rust crates are dual-licensed under Apache 2.0 as well so if that is something you want for this crate, let me know and I'd be happy to do so. Any contributions to the repo will be part of the project and thus under the same such licenses as the project. By submitting to the repo you acknowledge and agree to these terms (and as such you must have permission of the copyright holders of any assets included in your contributions to submit on their behalf and have them licensed as specified above).
