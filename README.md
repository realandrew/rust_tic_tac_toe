# Tic Tac Toe

This is a Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in the command terminal that's written in Rust. I (Andrew Mitchell) created this project as a way to learn Rust. I read through the first few chapters of the Rust book and then wrote the project. I may rewrite the project in the future if I learn enough new things to warrant it. I'm not currently planning to add many (if any) new features to this project, but if there's any interest in done so, feel free to ask about it so it can be discussed, I'm open to accept contributions.

This project is not currently on crates.io, but I might do so in the future (if enough functionality is added to warrant it).
