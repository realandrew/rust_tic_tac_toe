# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe (also called 'noughts and crosses' or 'Xs and Os' depending on locale) game that can be played in the terminal that's written in Rust. I created this project as a way to learn Rust. I read through the first few chapters of the Rust book and then wrote the project. Whilst the game works fine, I may rewrite the project in the future once I've read through more of the book. I'm not planning to add many (if any) new features to this project at the moment, but if there's any interest in doing so, feel free to open an issue for discussion, I'm open to accept contributions.

This project is not currently on crates.io as it's just a binary crate, but I may restructure it as a library in the future and publish it to crates.io.
